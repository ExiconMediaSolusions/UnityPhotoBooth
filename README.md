This project is aimed at building a photo booth game with several tools I wrote. âœ¨ **For more information, please refer to those individual pages**:
- [UnityWebcamTool](https://github.com/GimChuang/UnityWebcamTool) - Simple scripts to control webcam.
- [UnityPhotoTool](https://github.com/GimChuang/UnityPhotoTool) - Scripts for taking screenshots with countdown animation and chroma keying.
- [UnityFileIOUtility](https://github.com/GimChuang/UnityFileIOUtility) - Scripts to process some basic file I/O (eg. save texture as .jpg).
- [UnityWebTool](https://github.com/GimChuang/UnityWebTool) - Scripts to upload pictures to your server and generate QR codes with the pictures' url.

There are 2 sample scenes in this project:
- **Test_PhotoBooth** simply opens webcam, applies the WebCamTexture to a "chroma-keyable" material (press D to open the panel of chroma key settings). Countdown and flash animation will be played when you click the "Take Photo" button. The photo will be saved to your desired path.

- **Test_PhotoBooth_Web** adds simple functionality of choosing background for chroma-keying, uploading photo, and getting QR codes.
